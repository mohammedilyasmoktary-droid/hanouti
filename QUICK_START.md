# Quick Start Guide

## If you're in the wrong directory:

Make sure you're in the project directory:
```bash
cd /Users/ilyasmoktary/Desktop/Hanouti
```

## To restart the dev server:

1. **Stop any running server:**
   ```bash
   # Press Ctrl+C if you see a running server
   ```

2. **Clear cache and restart:**
   ```bash
   rm -rf .next
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Wait for compilation to finish**, then open:
   - Admin: http://localhost:3000/admin
   - Homepage: http://localhost:3000

## Current Status:

✅ Dev server has been started automatically
✅ Next.js cache has been cleared
✅ All fixes have been applied

The server should be running now. Check your terminal for the compilation output.
